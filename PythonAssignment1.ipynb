    "Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : We call python a general purpose and high level programming language because it is written in human readable and\n",
    "    understandable language and not in machine language (Binary language). It is used for multiple purpose like \n",
    "    Web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence etc. It also supports object oriented programming. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : Python is a dynamically typed language because we do not have to declare the type of the variable while assigning a \n",
    "    value.  In python the type of variable is determined only during runtime.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : Pros of Python programming language :\n",
    "        1. Easy to learn and read.\n",
    "        2. Vast collection of libraries.\n",
    "        3. Free, open-source and vibrant community.\n",
    "        4. Platform independent (Portable).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Cons of Python programming language :\n",
    "        1. Consumes a lot of memory space.\n",
    "        2. Weak in mobile computing.\n",
    "        3. Slower than compiled language.\n",
    "        4. No multithreading.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : We can use Python in following domains :\n",
    "        1. Data Engineering\n",
    "        2. Data analytics and data visualization\n",
    "        3. Data Science\n",
    "        4. AI and Machien Learning\n",
    "        5. Application development\n",
    "        6. Automation\n",
    "        7. Desktop GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : In Python variable is a container which stores values.\n",
    "    To declare a variable in Python we have to follow following rules :\n",
    "        1. Variable name must start with a letter or underscore.\n",
    "        2. Variabel name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "        3. Variabel name only contains alpha numeric characters and underscores.\n",
    "        4. Variable names are case sensitive.\n",
    "        5. Keywords cannot be used for naming variable.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    example:\n",
    "        ashu_21 = 2104\n",
    "        \n",
    "    In above example \"ashu_21\" is a variable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : We have to use input() function to take an input from the user in python.\n",
    "    example :\n",
    "        name = input(\"Enter Your name :\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : String is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is type casting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : The process of converting the value of one data type to another data type is type casting.\n",
    "    for example, by default we get string data type by input() function and if we want to get an int data type we can\n",
    "    do typecasting,\n",
    "    age = int(input(\"Enter your Age :\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : Yes, we can take multiple input from the user using single input() function with the help of split() and map() method.\n",
    "    example :\n",
    "        first_name, last_name = input(\"Enter the value :\").split()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        marks = list(map(int, input(\"Enter mark of diff subjects: \").split()))\n",

    "Q10. What are keywords?\n",
